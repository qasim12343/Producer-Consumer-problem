This repository contains an implementation of the classic Producer-Consumer problem in [programming language].


## Problem Description

The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical synchronization problem in computer science. It involves two types of processes, producers and consumers, that share a common fixed-size buffer or queue. The producers generate data items and add them to the buffer, while the consumers consume the data items from the buffer.

The main challenge in the Producer-Consumer problem is to ensure that the producers do not produce items when the buffer is full, and the consumers do not consume items when the buffer is empty. This requires proper synchronization and coordination between the producers and consumers.

## Implementation

In this repository, you will find an implementation of the Producer-Consumer problem using [programming language]. The code provides a solution that ensures proper synchronization and coordination between the producers and consumers.

The implementation includes the following components:

- `main.java`: This module contains the code for the producer process It generates data items and adds them to the shared buffer and the code for the consumer process It consumes data items from the shared buffer.
- `BufferQueuee.java`: This module represents the shared buffer. It provides methods for adding and removing items from the buffer, taking care of synchronization.

## Usage

To use this implementation of the Producer-Consumer problem, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and ensure you have [programming language] installed.
3. Run the `main.java` script to start the producer process and consumer process.
5. Observe the output, which demonstrates the synchronization between the producers and consumers.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different parameters to explore the behavior of the producer-consumer system.
